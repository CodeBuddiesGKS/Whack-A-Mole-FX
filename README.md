# Whack-A-Mole-FX
Whack-A-Mole Using JavaFX

The GUI implementation went quite well.
As a foreword, the game is still very glitchy. The point was not to build a game that was entirely glitch free.
The point of this project was to get used to using GitHub for commits and project version control and to explore JavaFX.
JavaFX has great tools for managing layouts and animations, however, the animation tools in JavaFX can be quite computationally intensive as each animation creates its own thread.

Nonetheless, I may continue with this project down the line and fix it up as time goes on.
As it currently stands, the project is good enough for a warm-up.

To play, just click the walking Mole in the beginning, watch the horde come at you and click as many moles as you can, when you fail (or when you glitch out) a mole will pop up and laugh while the crab shows your score.
